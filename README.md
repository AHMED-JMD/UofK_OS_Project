### Excersie (1)

this program creates a files and writes to it any string of characters and once a CTRL + c is pressed it listen to sigint signal and delete the file and terminate the program.

#### Temporary File Creation:

A file named "compfile" is created using fopen in write mode (w).
A string is written into the file and then closed using fclose.

#### Signal Handling:

The signal function is used to set a custom handler for SIGINT (Ctrl-C).
The handle_sigint function deletes the compfile and prints a success message when the signal is received.

#### Infinite Loop:

The program enters an infinite loop (while (1)) to simulate continuous work until interrupted by the user.
Cleanup on Signal:

#### When the user presses Ctrl-C, the handle_sigint function is called:

It deletes the file using remove.
Exits the program using exit.

#### Note : GPT was used to help write the code!

### Exercise (2)

This program demonstrates basic signal handling in C focusing on the SIGINT signal, which is generated by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.

- the program set up a custom signal handler using the sigaction system call
- block the SIGINT signal
- Waits for signals using the pause() function.
- Retrieves and displays any pending signals after a signal is received.

While the program is running, press Ctrl+C to trigger the SIGINT signal. The program will display the process ID and any pending signals before exiting.

#### Note : GPT was used as a helping tool and used extensively to write the Makefile

### Excersice (3)

The program calculates the time difference between now and the alarm time.
It sets a timeout for the alarm.
When the alarm triggers, it prompts the user to stop or snooze.
If the user chooses to snooze, it resets the alarm based on the provided time or defaults to 1 minute.

#### Note : GPT was used in developing the code.

Features:

- Input Parsing:
  Accepts HH:MM for time and optional YYYY-MM-DD for date.
- Validation:
  Ensures the given time is in the future.
- Signal Handling:
  Uses a minimal SIGALRM handler to set a flag.
- Users Action:
  Prompts the user to stop or snooze the alarm.
  Resets the alarm based on user input.
- Default Snooze:
  Defaults to 1 minute if no snooze time is entered
