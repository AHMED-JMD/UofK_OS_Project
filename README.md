### Excersie (1)

### Exercise (2)

This program demonstrates basic signal handling in C focusing on the SIGINT signal, which is generated by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal.

- the program set up a custom signal handler using the sigaction system call
- block the SIGINT signal
- Waits for signals using the pause() function.
- Retrieves and displays any pending signals after a signal is received.

While the program is running, press Ctrl+C to trigger the SIGINT signal. The program will display the process ID and any pending signals before exiting.

#### Note : GPT was used as a helping tool and used extensively to write the Makefile

### Excersice (3)

The program calculates the time difference between now and the alarm time.
It sets a timeout for the alarm.
When the alarm triggers, it prompts the user to stop or snooze.
If the user chooses to snooze, it resets the alarm based on the provided time or defaults to 2 minute.

#### used the help of chatgpt to develop the code

Key Features:

- Input Parsing:
  Accepts HH:MM for time and optional YYYY-MM-DD for date.
- Validation:
  Ensures the given time is in the future.
- Signal Handling:
  Uses a minimal SIGALRM handler to set a flag.
- Users Action:
  Prompts the user to stop or snooze the alarm.
  Resets the alarm based on user input.
- Default Snooze:
  Defaults to 2 minute if no snooze time is entered
